                <p className="text_gap">
                    To enhance the information architecture of the platform&apos;s extensive content, 
                    I initiated a content audit that involved 
                    <span className="p_bold"> indexing the Top 10 lists across three hierarchical levels: category, subcategory, and Top 10 lists. </span>
                    Each element was assigned a unique identifier using a hierarchical numbering system for better organization and clarity.
                </p>

                <p className="text_gap">
                    During this process, I identified that
                    <span className="p_bold"> more than 25% of the platform&apos;s content consisted of duplicate Top 10 lists </span>
                    residing in different areas of the website, which caused redundancy and confusion.
                    <span className="p_bold"> 50 lists were categorized as seasonal </span>
                    (Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc.), and
                    <span className="p_bold"> 15 lists were flagged as outdated </span>and no longer relevant.
                
                </p>

                <p className="text_gap">
                    Next, 
                    <span className="p_bold"> I created a visual representation of over 400 Top 10 lists, spread across 41 subcategories and 8 main categories. </span>
                    Based on the audit, we removed the duplicate Top 10 lists and moved the 50 seasonal lists 
                    to a dedicated seasonal category to keep them from cluttering the site throughout the year. 
                    Additionally, the 15 outdated lists were removed from the platform.

                <p className="text_gap">
                    Following this,
                    <span className="p_bold"> the content was reorganized into a more intuitive, taxonomy-based hierarchical structure, </span>
                    reducing the number of main categories from 8 to 6 and consolidating subcategories into 30 logical groupingsâ€”without 
                    losing any essential content.
